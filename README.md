# RelativeVisualAttention

In this study we propose using Relative Visual Attention (RVA), defined as visual attention to a visual cue divided by the cueâ€™s total screen time throughout the message, to measure attention to addiction-related visual cues and faces. We further examine the relationship between RVA to specific visual cues and addiction-related outcomes in the context of anti-vaping public service announcements (PSAs) aimed at reducing vaping behavior. It is unclear which visual cues are driving these effects. We investigated RVA to different message features within anti-vaping PSAs that do or do not include vapor. Further, we investigated how RVA to different addiction-related (e.g. cigarettes) and non- addiction-related (e.g. backpacks) as well as face and non-face visual cues is associated with behavioral and cognitive outcomes. Results suggest that vapor cues elicit more RVA in anti-vaping messages than other visual cues. Further, e- cigarette-related cues are eliciting lower intention to smoke and greater intention to vape when vapor is present. We show that RVA is a useful measure to operationalize visual attention.
